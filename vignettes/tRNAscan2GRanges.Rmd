# Getting started

The default tRNAscan-SE [@tRNAscanSE] output is formated text document containg 
text blocks per tRNA delimited by an empty line.

```{r}
file <- system.file("extdata", 
                    file = "tRNAscan.sort", 
                    package = "tRNAscan2GRanges")

# output for sacCer3
# Before
readLines(con = file, n = 7L)
```

# Converting to GRanges

To access the information in a BioC context the conversion to a GRanges object 
comes to mind. This task is performed by `tRNAscan2GRanges()`, which uses 
regular expressions to extract the information from the text blocks. The result
can be used directly or saved as gff3 file for further use.

```{r}
# After
gr <- tRNAscan2GRanges::tRNAscan2GRanges(file)
head(gr, 2)
```

# Session info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

# Literature

Depending on the development on tRNAscan-SE this might become redundant, since
a gff3 export by tRNAscan-SE might resolve the conversion issue.
