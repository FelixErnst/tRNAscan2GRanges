# tRNAscanImport

The default tRNAscan-SE [Lowe et el. 1997](#Literature) output is formatted text document containing 
text blocks per tRNA delimited by an empty line. 
To access the information in a BioC context the conversion to a GRanges object 
comes to mind. This task is performed by `import.tRNAscanAsGRanges()`, which uses 
regular expressions to extract the information from the text blocks. The result
can be used directly or saved as gff3 file for further use.

Refer to the vignette for an example usage case.

# Literature

Depending on the development on tRNAscan-SE this might become redundant, since
a gff3 export by tRNAscan-SE might resolve the conversion issue.
